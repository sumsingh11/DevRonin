# 👋 Hello, There! 
## I'm Sumit Singh. Nice to meet you!

## 🚀 About Me
I have a good background in tool-based coding, on platforms like Blue Prism and others for Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and other No Code/Low Code platform. Although my expertise has primarily been in using pre-built tools and interfaces to automate processes and solve problems. I’m now transitioning into the world of traditional coding languages, such as Js, C#, Html, css, etc. to expand my skill set further.

As a beginner in programming, I’m eager to apply my problem-solving skills and automation experience to coding projects while learning the foundational concepts of full stack development. My goal is to bridge my existing knowledge with new coding skills, allowing me to become a versatile developer capable.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools that I am learning are:-
